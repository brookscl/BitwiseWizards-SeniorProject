1. ### Too long of a title but this is for a school project so the fact that its long is okay were helping to hit a non existent word quota

![Mind map for RPG Game](RPG_Game/IdeasMap.jpg)

A RPG turn based combat using scenes to depict various battlefields  and different non-combative zones such as places to regain expended resources or obtain new ones. Using a database to fetch and store player data and records and a live service API such as websocket to allow for two way communication between the server and the client to allow for live sessions with other players.

Vision Statement:

"Made Virtual Combat" is a turn-based RPG designed to provide an engaging, story-driven experience for single players or groups of up to four, where every run feels unique and rewarding. Through strategic turn-based combat, players submit actions to a server for simultaneous resolution, prioritizing speed and move order to create dynamic encounters. Featuring a robust "Build" system, players can customize their characters using loot and items, synergizing abilities to adapt to increasing challenges. The game introduces a dynamic event system that interweaves environmental effects, such as weather or disasters, impacting gameplay and offering preparation opportunities. With an integrated achievement system, players can track personal and global milestones, fostering a sense of community and competition. While inspired by games like Divinity: Original Sin and Slay the Spire, "Made Virtual Combat" stands out by combining collaborative storytelling, evolving challenges, and a global tracking system to ensure a continually fresh and immersive experience.

1. ### TrustTrade

TrustTrade would be a social platform that revolutionizes how traders interact by requiring portfolio verification through Plaid integration (optional but highlighted). Users who connect their brokerage accounts get a "Verified Portfolio" badge, displaying their real-time portfolio value, current stock positions, option contracts, and quantity of holdings. This verification system creates a hierarchy of trust, where verified users' posts and analyses carry more weight than unverified accounts. The platform would feature a "Performance Score" that tracks verified users' trading history, win rates, and risk-adjusted returns, making it impossible to fake success. Users can create detailed trade journals with entry/exit points, reasoning, and outcome analysis, all backed by verified transaction data.

Vision Statement:

TrustTrade, To build an open and transparent trading community where everyone can learn, grow, and succeed together. By combining verified performance with accessible knowledge sharing, we're creating a space where both novice and experienced traders can collaborate, validate their strategies, and help each other achieve financial success.
